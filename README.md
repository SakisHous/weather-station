# weather-station
This project demonstrates the use of Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano for monitoring temperature and humidity in a house. The purpose is to measure the temperature and humidity both inside and outside.

This could be used with a smart system for monitoring the energy consumption of a buildings. Especially, the energy for heating (e.g. gas consumption) or for cooling it in summers with air-conditioners and the use of dehumidifiers. 

In order to store the data in the cloud we made use of Google Sheets and Google Drive. We can download the csv files and perform analytics with Machine Learning libraries in our PC or we can use an online notebook such as CoLab.
