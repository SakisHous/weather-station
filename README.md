# weather-station
This project demonstrates the use of Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano for monitoring temperature and humidity in a house. The purpose is to measure the temperature and humidity both inside and outside.

This could be used with a smart system for monitoring the energy consumption of a buildings. Especially, the energy for heating (e.g. gas consumption) or for cooling it in summers with air-conditioners and the use of dehumidifiers.
